# Sentiment_Analysis
Movie Review Analysis Tool
A dual-purpose text analysis application that combines sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection for movie reviews and other text inputs.
Overview
This project integrates two powerful NLP models to provide comprehensive text analysis:

Sentiment Analysis: A DistilBERT-based classifier trained on movie reviews to determine if text expresses positive or negative sentiment.
Sarcasm Detection: A context-aware BERT model that detects sarcastic statements by analyzing both semantic content and linguistic patterns.

The application provides a user-friendly GUI where users can enter text and get instant analysis using either model.
